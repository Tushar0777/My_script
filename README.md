# My_script

# 🚀 My own Computer Language Interpreter

> A robust and modular interpreter for a custom scripting language, designed to handle variables, operations, conditionals, and loops with ease.



## 🌟 Features  

🔑 **Lexical Analysis**  
- Tokenizes input into meaningful components like integers, floats, variables, operations, and keywords.  

🌳 **Parsing**  
- Constructs an Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) to represent program structure.

⚡ **Execution**  
- Executes the AST to handle arithmetic, boolean expressions, and control flow seamlessly.

## 💻 Supported Syntax  

### ✅ **Variable Declaration**  
```plaintext
make variable_name = expression

✅ Arithmetic Operations
+, -, *, /
✅ Boolean Operations
and, or, not
✅ Comparisons
>, <, >=, <=, ?=
✅ Conditional Statements
if condition do action  
elif condition do action  
else do action

✅ Loops
while condition do action
```
